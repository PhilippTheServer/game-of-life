// Rules:
// 1. A Cell that has less then 2 neighboors dies.
// 2. A Cell that has 2 - 3 alive neighboors lives.
// 3. A Cell that has more then 3 alive neighboors dies.
// 4. A Cell that hsa 3 alive neighboors gets alive too.



// Terminal as canvas:
// 1. Get current width and height to use as the borders
// 2. Reduce flickering
// 3. Remove cursor
// 4. Draw on the Terminal


// Seat a random layout on start



// logic to precompute next alive cells to avoid fps drops
